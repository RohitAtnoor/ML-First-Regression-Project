💎 Diamond Price Prediction

This Project predicts the price of Diamonds based on their attributes. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Ineuron.

The project involved the following steps:
🔬 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
🧹 Data cleaning
🛠️ Feature engineering
🚀 Model Building
🚀 Model Deployment

The following machine learning models were used:
Linear regression
Lasso
Ridge
Elastic net

The best model was a linear regression model with regularization.
The project was deployed in the Azure Cloud environment.

Learnings
This project helped me learn about the importance of EDA, feature engineering, and model selection. I also learned how to deploy a machine learning model in the cloud.

Python programming: I have used Python to write the code for the project, including the EDA, feature engineering, model building, and deployment.

SQL: I have used SQL to extract the data from the database. 

Flask web development: I have used Flask to create a web app that allows users to predict the price of diamonds. This is a simple web app which takes user input and give the predicted price. This program will not store any user data or input. 

EDA and feature engineering: With the help of EDA i was able to explore the data and to identify features that could be used to predict the price of diamonds. With the help of feature engineering i was able to analyse the importance of the features for price prediction.

Machine learning model building and deployment: Based on the analysis as this was a regression problem i have used Linear regression to built a machine learning model.
